							<p> CloudTrail is an AWS service allowing customers to record and track the API activities occuring in their AWS accounts. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-lake.html" target=”_blank”>Lake</a> is a recently launched feature in CloudTrail allowing constomers to query for the events with the help of SQL commands.
								As part of my internship project, I designed and developed a synchronous query API in AWS CloudTrail Lake to query for the events(API activities) generated by the customers on their AWS accounts.

								As a Software Engineer at Sandvine, I was part of the Infrastructure automation and Tools Development Team. I developed a command line through which our customers use the interface to reserve the desired network topology from the Sandvine Lab. 
								Also, I worked on creating a web interface using AngularJS, Django and Postgres SQL that helped customers interact with our tools. I worked in a team of 3 people on a project to support infrastructure automation tools(Orchestration and test automation) for cloud-ready and cloud-native deployments.
								On a typical day, my work includes design review, writing code for infrastructure automation tools, unit testing, code reviews, and bug fixing.

								<p> Designed and developed a collaborative code editor with a live editing platform, where multiple people can view and edit the file synchronously.  It is a web-based application that allows multiple users to simultaneously view and edit code files over a distributed environment. It provides the features for a seamless editing experience among the users.  The platform has the functionality to view the list of active users working on a file.

								<p> Edges in an images are the combination of points where there is a sudden change in pixel's intensity. Sobel's algorithm works on detecting 2 types of edges: horizantal and vertical. For horizantal edges, The input image is convolved with horizantal mask: [[1, 2, 1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, -2, -1]] and for vertical edges, the input image is convolved with vertical mask: [[1, 0, -1], [2, 0, -2], [1, 0, -1]]. Once the image is processed in horizantal and vertical directions, add the magnitude of corresponding pixels to generate the final edge detected image.</p>
